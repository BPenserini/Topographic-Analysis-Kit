TopoTools is currently undergoing a rennovation, below is a running list of changes that will be (or have been) implemented.
Also, TopoTools is being renamed to Topographic Analysis Kit (TAK) to avoid confusion with TopoToolbox itself

KsnProfiler: add slope-area plot option (option to include it, not replace chi-z) with option to pick segments on this
KsnProfiler: slope-break KPs output as knickpoints (with option for shapefile)
KsnProfiler: add min_elev and max_area criteria from SegmentPicker (to stop extracting streams)
KsnProfiler: display mean values ksn values above ksn vs chi (with uncertainty maybe)
KsnProfiler: add fits on slope-area plot and ksn vs distance?
KsnProfiler: Way to convert/link between chi and slope area (shared scale? coloring?)
KsnProfiler: Update image methods to remove real2rgb usage
MakeCombinedSwath: Update to accept table output from Basin2Shape
SegmentPicker: add slope-area plot option
ALL: check functionality with new version of TopoToolbox
ALL: check interoperability / similarity between parameter names and inputs

***DONE: ProcessRiverBasins: Add option to autoextract based on elevation
***DONE: FindBasinKnicks: Add optional inputs for chi values, update plotting, and add option to output shapefiles directly
***DONE: ChiGrid: Figure out base level issue
***DONE: Produce wrapper for all the different DEM conditioning techniques
***DONE: KSN_Chi_Batch: add option to provide conditioned DEM
***DONE: KSN_Chi_Batch: replace chigrid with chigrid calc from divide tools
***DONE: KSN_Chi_Batch: implement ksn grid interpolation
***DONE: ALL: fix calls to chitransform (Wolfgang fixed initial error where A was treated as DA)
