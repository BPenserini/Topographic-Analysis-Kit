## Topographic Analyis Kit for TopoToolbox ##
## (As of 5/23/18 Master and Development have been merged) ##
## A major rewrite of the code is (mostly) complete in preparation for release, but README has not been fully updated yet ##

These are a series of matlab functions written by Adam M. Forte (aforte8 'at' lsu.edu) that build upon the functionality of TopoToolbox (https://github.com/wschwanghart/topotoolbox). Each function contains a header with basic functionality info along with expected inputs and possible outputs. This readme compiles some of that information and lays out possible workflows, but see 'Suggested_Workflows.pdf' for complete flowchart. Discussions of workflows and tools assume a basic familiarity with the TopoToolbox data classes and Matlab functions. At present there are two semi-permanent branches of the code, the 'master' which contains versions of the code that I'm (reasonably) sure are stable and work properly and the 'development' which are the bleeding edge versions that I'm tinkering with (or it may be exactly the same as the master). These may have new functionality, but they also may be broken, so use with caution. 

# Getting Started
The first step in most processing workflows is going to the 'MakeStreams' function, which takes a georeferenced DEM file as either a GeoTiff or ascii and produces the basic TopoToolbox datasets (DEM as a GRIDobj, flow direction as FLOWobj, flow accumulation as GRIDobj, and stream network as STREAMobj). There are various options to modify the DEM based on user input. All other functions require at least some of the outputs from this function. There are several helper functions to hydrologically condition the DEM ('ConditionDEM'), remove flat areas ('RemoveFlats'), or determine a suitable threshold drainage area ('FitThreshold')


# Ksn and Chi Maps (Batch Mode)
If you want to make maps of normalized channel steepness (ksn) or chi for all streams identified in 'MakeStreams', use the 'KsnChiBatch' function. This function can be used to produce streams colored by ksn or chi (sensu Willett al al, 2014, Science) or alternatively a continuous grid of chi or ksn. Note that for ksn, this function produce shapefiles suitable for use in ArcGIS, where as the chi options produce ascii files importable as rasters into ArcGIS. This is because of the way Matlab deals with shapefiles, so to produce a shapefile of a chi map, import your ascii into ArcGIS and then use the raster to polyline tool. Grid options are output as ascii grids.

# Interactive Ksn Definition
The function 'KsnProfiler' is designed to mimic Profiler_51 (Wobus et al, 2006) but without any required interaction with ArcGIS and lots of added features. The user selects channel heads on a map and after the selection of each channel head is able to pick segments of the stream. There are a variety of alternative methods to select streams (e.g. shapefile of channel heads, x-y locations of channel heads, iterate through all streams in a provided network, etc). The user can choose to either choose segments on the basis of chi-z plots, longitudinal stream profiles, or slope-area. There are options to determine suitable threshold area by individual stream segments, remove incomplete portions of stream networks, choose whether to avoid fitting the same portion of a trunk stream multiple times (i.e. any overlapping portion of a stream network that has already been fit is excluded from the rest of the analysis), etc. The code will output a series of arrays containing the channel information and will also export a shapefile containing the relevant streams and data. There is a separate function ('ClassifyKnicks') to classify the knickpoints/breakpoints defined during stream fitting.

# Watershed Statistics and Clipping
One of the powerful aspects of TopoToolbox is to automate otherwise tedious processes (i.e. things that are annoying to do in Arc). One of those groups of tasks is to select a series of watersheds, clip them out, and calculate statistics. The 'ProcessRiverBasins' function is designed to do just this. To use this tool, you will need to have run 'MakeStreams' but also have a list of basin mouths (i.e. pour points) for your basins of interest (x-y coordinates, shapefile of river mouths). It is strongly recommended that you use the output shapefile of the stream network from 'MakeStreams' to pick basin mouths in Arc. DO NOT use a shapefile made from the hydrologic processing in Arc because the flow routing between Arc and TopoToolbox is slightly different, thus coordinates will not necessarily be the same. Once you have your matrix of river mouths, the 'ProcessRiverBasins' function will iteratively go through and clip out the DEM above this pour point and recalculate the stream network and produce various maps (e.g. chi map, ksn, etc) along with basin averaged statistics (e.g. ksn, gradient, etc). There are options to include additional GRIDobjs and by using the 'CatPoly2GRIDobj' function, also add categorical polygon data (e.g. a geologic map). 

A companion function 'SubDivideBigBasins' is designed to be run after successfully running 'ProcessRiverBasins'. This function will find any resulting basin from the first function with a drainage area over a user defined threshold  (e.g. 100 km^2) and subdivide it down to smaller basins. There are a variety of methods for subdividing. Outputs from both 'ProcessRiverBasins' and 'SubDivideBigBasins' are written as individual mat files for each watershed, identified by the river number within the original pour points matrix. The code can be run with an option to also generate shapefiles and grids for each subdivided basins that can be viewed in Arc.

# Further Processing of Outputs from Watershed Clipping
'Basin2Shape' and 'Basin2Raster' allows the production of composite polygon shapefiles and ascii grids, respectively, containing various user defined statistics calculated during ProcessRiverBasins. Find The 'PlotIndividualBasins' function will iterate through all results from 'ProcessRiverBasins' and 'SubDivideBigBasins' and plot a three panel figure with the longitudinal profile, chi-elevation, and slope-area plots. Each figure will be saved as a separate pdf.

# Interactive Selection 
Several functions are designed to allow interactive selection of river profiles or basins. 'PickBasin' allows the user to interactively select a pour point and export a clipped DEM of that watershed. 'DetritalSamplePicker' is similar to 'PickBasin', but it allows the user to select an arbitrarily large number of basins. This function is designed to aid a user in selecting watersheds that meet certain criteria, e.g. if you are looking for basins that are a certain size and are well adjusted for sampling for cosmo. For each basin selected, the function will dislplay a chi-z relationship along with the stream profile and allow you to either accept (i.e. save) or reject (i.e. don't save) the basin you picked. 'FindKnicks' is an interactive picker for knickpoints on a basin file from 'ProcessRiverBasins' or 'SubDivideBigBasins' which allows the user to select knickpoints on chi-elevation plots. 'SegmentPicker' allows the user to choose multiple individual drainage networks (above selected pour points) or multiple individual channels (down from selected channel heads) from a selected basin file. 'SegmentPlotter' will plot the specified results of using the 'SegmentPicker' function.

# Other Functions
There are several other functions in the folder, many of these are helper functions used by some of the above functions (i.e. put the whole folder and all of its subfolders on your path or things will break!). There is a folder called 'SwathTools' which contains some functions that wrap TopoToolbox's existing and (powerful) SWATHobj functions.
